Technologies Used

MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It offers:

High Performance: Efficiently handles large volumes of data and high traffic loads.
High Availability: Ensures data redundancy and automatic failover with replica sets.
Easy Scalability: Seamlessly scales horizontally by adding more servers.
Express.js
Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the development process with:

HTTP Utility Methods: A wide range of methods to handle various HTTP requests and responses.
Middleware: Built-in and third-party middleware to handle tasks like authentication, logging, and data parsing.
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
CORS is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain. This is crucial for enabling the frontend of BistroBoss to communicate with the backend server by:

Enabling Secure Data Requests: Ensuring that only authorized domains can access the server's resources.
Improving Functionality: Allowing the frontend and backend to interact seamlessly, even if they are hosted on different domains.
